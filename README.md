# Approach

Basic application using MVVM, combined with typical android libraries like Hilt, Room, Retrofit, okhttp etc

Coroutines and flowable pattern is used for reactive architecture

# Next Steps

- Clean up recyclerview adapter and move to view binding, some quick copy paste to get it working
- Another styling pass and implementation of custom layout manager to handle phones
- Probably not a good idea to pass around VM, but has been awhile since using livedata object directly
- UX improvements, Loading Dialogs, Error popups, auto refresh/pull to refresh, last updated field
- Move data layer to new module to improve expandability
- Provide values through strings.xml / decrease hardcoding
- Implement some tests both unit and functional
